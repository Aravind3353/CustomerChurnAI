# ðŸ“‰ Customer Churn Prediction

This is a machine learning project to predict customer churn using real-world telecom data. It includes end-to-end steps from data cleaning and model training to a Streamlit-based prediction app.

## ðŸ§  Project Objective

To build a predictive model that identifies whether a customer is likely to churn (leave) based on their contract, usage, and service information.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

- **Source**: [IBM Sample Telco Customer Churn Dataset](https://www.ibm.com/communities/analytics/watson-analytics-blog/guide-to-sample-datasets/)
- File used: `WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv`
- Location: `data/` folder

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Pandas** & **NumPy** â€“ Data wrangling
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** â€“ Visualization
- **Scikit-learn** â€“ Model building (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- **XGBoost** â€“ Gradient boosting model
- **Joblib** â€“ Model serialization
- **Streamlit** â€“ App interface

## ðŸš€ How to Run the Project Locally

### 1. Clone the repository or download the folder:

```bash
